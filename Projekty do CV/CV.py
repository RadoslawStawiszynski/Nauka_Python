# My adventure with the Python programming language began a year ago.
# During this time I learned the basics of the language, learned how to use repositories, eg Math,
# and created some small projects (available on Github).
# I am constantly learning new things and looking for solutions for my projects.
# In this learning I relies on the experience of my friends from the IT industry and
# websites supporting the work of a programmer, such as stackoverflow.com and others.
